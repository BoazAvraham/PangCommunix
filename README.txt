Hi there :)
Thanks for the apportunity! I had a lot of fun though no a lot of time sadly.
I prototyped fast, and wanted to sumbit asap since I won't have more time this week.
out of the extra features, I added:
1. Architecture designed with MVC paradigm  - though only partially 
2. Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty
3. Custom visuals and shaders
4. Custom soundtracks and SFX - though only for ball pops (just because it is sooo satisfying)

You can also see in the code that I laid the founations for 2 players, and leaderboard (which is currently only a highscore)

Thanks again and enjoy ! :)
